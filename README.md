# Customer_Behavior_Community_Detection
<div align="center">üõçÔ∏è Customer Behavior Analysis & Community Detection üõçÔ∏èUncovering customer purchasing patterns through graph-based community detection.</div>‚ñ∫ OverviewThis project provides an in-depth analysis of customer shopping behavior to identify distinct communities based on purchasing patterns. By transforming customer purchase data into a network graph, we apply the Louvain Community Detection algorithm to reveal hidden structures within the customer base. The insights from this analysis are invaluable for creating targeted marketing campaigns, personalizing customer experiences, and driving sales growth.<div align="center"><img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/2d3748/ffffff?text=Network+Visualization+of+Customer+Communities" alt="Network Visualization with Communities"><br/><em>Visualization of the detected customer communities. Replace this placeholder with your actual project graph.</em></div>‚ñ∫ Project WorkflowThe analysis follows a systematic pipeline to process the data and uncover insights:Data Ingestion:Customer shopping data is imported from a SQL Server database into a Jupyter environment.Feature Engineering:A customer-product matrix is created, mapping customers to the items they've purchased.Item Weighting with IDF:Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is calculated to assign higher importance to unique items that differentiate customer preferences.Similarity Calculation:A Cosine Similarity matrix is computed to determine the pairwise similarity between customers based on their weighted purchase vectors.Graph Construction:The similarity matrix is converted into a network graph, where nodes represent customers and weighted edges represent the strength of their purchasing similarity.Community Detection:The Louvain method is applied to the graph to partition customers into distinct communities.‚ñ∫ Key Results & EvaluationThe model's performance was evaluated using the Modularity score, which measures the strength of division of a network into modules (or communities).Modularity Score: 0.79A score of 0.79 indicates a high degree of modularity, signifying that the identified communities are well-defined and statistically significant. This confirms that the customer base can be effectively segmented based on purchasing behavior.‚ñ∫ Tech StackThis project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:Language: PythonEnvironment: Jupyter NotebookDatabase: SQL ServerCore Libraries:pandas for data manipulationnumpy for numerical operationspyodbc for database connectionscikit-learn for cosine similaritynetworkx for graph creationcommunity (python-louvain) for community detectionmatplotlib / seaborn for visualization‚ñ∫ How to UseTo get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
